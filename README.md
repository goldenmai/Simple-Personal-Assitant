# Simple-Personal-Assitant
I want to try some new technology to solve some everday problem. The first thing is to manage contracts and events. Record the data, raise reminder when the time comes.
So the basic boundary is to:
- manage: contracts and events
- manage trough: manual input, voice or text scanner
- supprt mutil langauge
- web service with strict data protection

I want to try with AWS to check how soon can I build an application.

It will be hard but should also be fun.
